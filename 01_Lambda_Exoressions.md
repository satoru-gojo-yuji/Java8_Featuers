## Main Aim of Java-8
- To simplify the programming 
- To enable functional programming 
- To write more readabl and concise code 

- to introduce lots of new apis
- changed coding style with new apis

### New Features in Java-8
- **Lambda Expression**
- **Functional Interfaces**
  - Consumer 
  - Supplier
  - Predicate
  - Function
- **Stream API**
- **Interface changes (dafult & Static method)**
- **Date and Time API**
- **Optional class**
- **Special Iterator**
- **StringJoiner**
- **Method References**
- **Construtor References**
- **Collection Framework changes**


**Java is an Object programming language. By introducing Lambdas in java it is supporting Functional programming also.**


|OOP|Functional Programming|
|------------|----------------|
|In the Object Oriented Programming classes and object is the main entities.|In Functinal programming, function can exist outside the scope of an object.
|If you want to create the function in OOP language, that function should be created inside the class.| We can assign function to refference variable.|
|                    | One function can be passed as a prameter to an another function|


### What is Lambda
A Lambda Expression is just an anonymous function 
- No Name 
- No Returen type 
- No Access modifiers  

``````java
public void m1()
{
  sout("Hello");
}

Conver to Lambda Expression

()->sout("Hello")
```````````

### Why to use Lambda Expression 
- To write functional programming in java
- To write more readable, maintable and concise code
